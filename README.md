The data for this project comes from a paper by JCU researchers and was analysed as part of a university course called BC5203: Advanced Bioinformatics, 
coordinated by Ira Cooke. The full paper can be found at this link: [Shiel et al 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0044848620302301?via%3Dihub). 
The raw data of the experiment is very large, therefore a partially processed data is used and obtained from this link: (https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/P3AMORiB2ZrbywE/download)
